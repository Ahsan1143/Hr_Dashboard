# Hr_Dashboard
This personal project explores employee attrition using a fictional HR dataset in Power BI. The dashboard follows a narrative-driven approach to uncover patterns behind employee turnover. It uses DAX measures and calculated columns to derive insights, visualize key trends, and support data-driven HR decisions.
